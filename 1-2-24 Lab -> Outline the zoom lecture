The first part of class, we went over the syllabus, and talked about his past in his many different fields of study, 
then we went to getting NetBeans set up, we started on how we work with getting all the right codes set up,
we went over how our first program is coded. With all the fields marked, we were then to make Hello World,
the first program we would write in an IDE to see if things worked.

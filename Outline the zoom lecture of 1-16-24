Going to start by teaching us loops

The ++ operator allows us to add 1 to the variable. val++ is the same as val = val + a;
++ can be before or after the var. ++val or val++.
++val, is adds before the equation,
val++ adds it after.

same with --

Loop :
while (expression)
     statement
while (number <=5){
cout << "hello\n";
number++;
}
says hello 5 times
no break in anything other than switch cases.
arrays and for loops go together.

int x=1;
do{ cout << x << endl;}
while(x < 0);

for loop
for(int; test; update)
state; // or block in {}
;
for (int count = 1; count <=5; count++)
cout << "Hello" << endl;
start stop step;
You can initialize more than 1 in for loop and update the loops (x++, y++)
bool statements can only have 1 (x<=5)
you cannot use a blank 
XXXX(; num <=10; num++) XXXX

running total accumulated sum of numbers from each rep of loop

x
 y
 !x 
!y
 x&&y 
x||y
x^y
X^y^y
x^y^x
!(x&&y)
!x||!y
!(x||y)
!x&&!y

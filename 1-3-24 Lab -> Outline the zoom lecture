Covered Chapter 1 of Gaddis:

Why program, talked about his back ground in the field, allows us to earn money.

Pc to make programmers and become a programmer

Talked about what issues with slides, mainly that we need a CPU, main memory, Secondary memory, input devices like keyboards and mice, and output devices like monitors.

 

Input process output.

talked about our main memory. we should build our own PC

talked about algorithms.

Machine language are 1's and 0's.

talked about different languages : C, C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Cobol, Fortran, Basic, Ruby and Visual Basic

2 process the input data,

3 Display the results as output by sending it to the screen or by having it write to a file.

He would like us to write the process we use by hand.

talked about procedural and object-oriented programming.

moved to chapt 2.

we talked about we should always comment our code, at least once every 5 lines.

also talked about our special char's. // # <> () {} "" and ;

Moved to cout object. it means Character output.

putting cout << "Hello World";

will output Hello World

endl; will give you an add a line worth of spaces same as '\n'.
